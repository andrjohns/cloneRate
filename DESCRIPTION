Description: Various methods to quickly estimate net growth rates of
    clones using methods from "Growth rate estimation from coalescent
    theory", Johnson et al. 2023. Uses coalescent theory to infer early
    growth trajectory of clones assuming that reconstructed trees are
    time-based (or mutation-based if a mutation rate is known/estimated).
