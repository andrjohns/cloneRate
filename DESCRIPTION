Description: Various methods to quickly estimate net growth rates of clones
    using methods from "Growth rate estimation from coalescent theory", Johnson 
    et al. 2023. Uses coalescent theory to infer early growth trajectory of 
    clones assuming that reconstructed trees are time-based (or mutation-based
    if a mutation rate is known/estimated).
