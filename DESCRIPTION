Description: Methods to quickly estimate the net growth rate of a
    population or clone whose growth can be approximated by a birth-death
    branching process.  Input should be phylogenetic trees of clones with
    edge lengths corresponding to either time or mutations. Based on
    coalescent results in "Estimating single cell clonal dynamics in human
    blood using coalescent theory", Johnson et al. 2023.
