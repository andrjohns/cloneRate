Description: Methods to quickly estimate the net growth rate of a population or
    clone whose growth can be approximated by a birth-death branching process. 
    Input should be phylogenetic trees of clones with edge lengths corresponding 
    to either time or mutations. Based on coalescent results in "Estimating 
    single cell clonal dynamics in human blood using coalescent theory", Johnson
    et al. 2023.
