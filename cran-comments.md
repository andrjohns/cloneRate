## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted all T and F to TRUE and FALSE.

* Removed package installations from running in README and vignettes, removing or setting "eval = FALSE".

* Reset user's par() after changing it in a vignette.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

* This is a new release.
